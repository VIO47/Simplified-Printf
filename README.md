# Simplified-Printf
University assignment at Computer Organisation
This is an assignment that I had at CSE1400 during my first year. 
The task was simple: create a version of the printf command without using any of the functions that are provided by the C library in Assembly x86.
We had to take in consideration when we would have more than 6 elements to print.
Note: %s - signed integer
      %u - unsigned integer
      %% - percentage sign to be printed
      %d - string
      %(any other character) - the character after % will be printed
